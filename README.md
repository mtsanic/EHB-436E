# EHB-436E
This repository contains the laboratory files of Digital Systems Design Laboratory(EHB 436E) course at Istanbul Techincal University.
Most of assignments are done on Nexys-2 FPGA board. Verilog is used as design language.

I tried to give as much information as I can, including codes, reports and experiment information.
